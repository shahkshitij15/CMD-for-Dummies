# CMD-for-Dummies
Generation of Linux commands through Natural Language with Remote Access to Terminal

Flutter app with Flask backend

## Problem solved 
Today most of the users don't remember the exact linux shell commands. They know what they want but cannot recollect the command for the same. This is where "cmd For Dummies" comes in; the user has to simply type the description (nothing greater than a single line, of course) of the command in simple conversational English. Our novel neural network model will extract the command which the user is trying to execute and return the output to the app. For example, if a user wants to see all the files in the directory but does not remember the command for the same, he/she can simply write "list all file" our model will understand the text and execute the ls command.
Benefits:- 
- It is useful for new users or any users who do not remember the command  
- Easy use of terminal 
- Attracts more users to open source 
- Remote access of any other computer with the app. i.e, the user just needs to interact with the app 
- Naive user friendly 

Some of the commands that can be run are:-
- cd 
- ls 
- man 
- touch 
- mkdir 
- rmdir
